# MiniHLSL Interpreter Fuzzer - Current Status

## Overview
We have successfully created a trace-guided fuzzing framework for the MiniHLSL interpreter that captures execution traces and generates semantically-equivalent mutations to find bugs in control flow and wave operation handling.

## Completed Components

### 1. Core Framework Structure
- **MiniHLSLInterpreterFuzzer.h**: Main fuzzer framework header with:
  - ExecutionTrace data structures for capturing complete execution state
  - Mutation strategy interfaces
  - Semantic validator for checking equivalence
  - Bug reporter for tracking found issues
  - Main fuzzer orchestrator

- **MiniHLSLInterpreterFuzzer.cpp**: Core implementation with:
  - Basic mutation strategy implementations (placeholder for now)
  - Semantic validator
  - Bug reporter
  - LibFuzzer integration

- **MiniHLSLInterpreterTraceCapture.h/cpp**: Trace capture interpreter that extends the base interpreter with hooks to capture:
  - Block execution patterns
  - Control flow decisions
  - Wave operation synchronization
  - Variable writes
  - Memory accesses
  - Barrier synchronization

### 2. Mutation Strategies (Defined, Implementation Pending)
- **ExplicitLaneDivergenceMutation**: Convert implicit divergence to explicit lane tests
- **LoopUnrollingMutation**: Unroll loops with exact iteration guards
- **PrecomputeWaveResultsMutation**: Replace wave ops with traced results
- **RedundantWaveSyncMutation**: Add extra synchronization
- **ForceBlockBoundariesMutation**: Make implicit blocks explicit
- **SerializeMemoryAccessesMutation**: Add barriers between memory accesses

### 3. Infrastructure
- **MiniHLSLInterpreterFuzzerMutations.cpp**: Placeholder for mutation implementations
- **CMakeLists.txt**: Updated build configuration
- **test_fuzzer.cpp**: Simple test program to verify compilation
- **Seeds**: Example HLSL programs for testing

## Current Limitations

### 1. AST Manipulation
The main limitation is that we don't have proper AST cloning/manipulation infrastructure. The interpreter's AST nodes don't have `clone()` methods, which prevents us from:
- Creating modified versions of statements
- Building new AST structures from existing ones
- Implementing the actual mutations

### 2. Missing Interpreter Hooks
While we added virtual hook methods to the MiniHLSLInterpreter base class, we need to actually call these hooks from the appropriate places in the interpreter implementation:
- In variable assignment statements
- When entering/exiting blocks
- During wave operation execution
- At control flow decisions

### 3. Incomplete TraceCaptureInterpreter
The trace capture needs to properly override the base interpreter's execution methods to capture traces. Currently it's a separate class but needs deeper integration.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Add AST cloning infrastructure**: Implement `clone()` methods for all AST nodes
2. **Call trace hooks**: Add calls to the virtual hook methods in the interpreter
3. **Implement mutations**: Once AST cloning works, implement the actual mutations
4. **Test with real programs**: Run the fuzzer on the seed programs

### Future Enhancements
1. **AST serialization**: Implement proper serialization for libFuzzer integration
2. **Coverage feedback**: Use execution traces to guide mutation selection
3. **Bug deduplication**: Group similar bugs together
4. **Minimization**: Reduce bug-triggering programs to minimal reproducers

## How to Build and Test

```bash
# Build the test program
cd build
cmake ..
make test-minihlsl-fuzzer

# Run the test
./test-minihlsl-fuzzer
```

## Architecture Summary

The fuzzer follows a trace-guided approach:

1. **Capture Golden Trace**: Execute the seed program and record complete execution trace
2. **Generate Mutations**: Apply semantics-preserving transformations based on the trace
3. **Execute Mutants**: Run mutated programs and capture their traces
4. **Validate Equivalence**: Compare mutant traces with golden trace
5. **Report Bugs**: If traces diverge, we found a bug in the interpreter

The key insight is that semantically-equivalent programs should produce identical execution results, so any divergence indicates an interpreter bug.
