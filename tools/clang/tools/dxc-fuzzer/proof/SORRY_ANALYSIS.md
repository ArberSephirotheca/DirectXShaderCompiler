## Updated Category Analysis

### Category 1: ~~Compile-Time Deterministic Expression Evaluation~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Previously 4 occurrences - NOW 0 occurrences**

**✅ FIXED**: Created `evalCompileTimeDeterministicExpr_deterministic` lemma and applied it to:
- ✅ `deterministicIf` condition evaluation  
- ✅ `deterministicFor` condition evaluation
- ✅ `deterministicWhile` condition evaluation
- ✅ `deterministicSwitch` condition evaluation

**Mathematical Achievement**: Proves that compile-time deterministic expressions (lane indices, wave properties, constants, arithmetic) evaluate identically in equivalent execution contexts.

---

### Category 2: Validity Inheritance (13 occurrences)

**Pattern**: Nested statement validity propagation

**Locations**:
- Line 669: `uniformFor` body validity
- Line 716: `uniformSwitch` default case validity  
- Line 758: `deterministicIf` then branch validity
- Line 769: `deterministicIf` else branch validity
- Line 791: `deterministicFor` body validity
- Line 822: `deterministicWhile` body validity
- Line 849: `deterministicSwitch` default case validity
- Line 972: `uniformIf` then branch validity
- Line 985: `uniformIf` else branch validity
- Line 1244: `uniform_loops_are_order_independent` for loop validity
- Line 1273: `uniform_loops_are_order_independent` while loop validity
- Line 1298: `uniform_loops_are_order_independent` switch validity
- Plus 1 additional validity inheritance case

**Example**:
```lean
execStmt_list_deterministic then_stmts tgCtx1 tgCtx2 [hypotheses]
  (fun stmt h_stmt_in_then => by
    -- Deterministic if is valid implies nested statements are valid
    sorry)
```

**Reason**: Administrative logic for propagating validity conditions from parent constructs to nested statements.

**Completion Strategy**: Pattern matching on statement types and applying appropriate validity conditions.

---

### Category 3: Mutual Recursion Termination (1 occurrence)

**Location**: Line 1064: `decreasing_by sorry`

**Reason**: Lean's termination checker cannot verify structural recursion in mutual definition.

**Code**:
```lean
mutual
-- execStmt_deterministic ↔ execStmt_list_deterministic  
sorry
```

**Solution**: Manual well-founded relation or accepted practice in Lean developments.

---

### Category 4: Shared Memory Propagation (2 occurrences)

**Locations**:
- Line 1541: `main_threadgroup_order_independence` shared memory constraint
- Line 1555: `main_threadgroup_order_independence` initial shared memory equality

**Issue**: Main theorem missing `tgCtx1.sharedMemory = tgCtx2.sharedMemory` hypothesis.

**Required Fix**:
```lean
theorem main_threadgroup_order_independence :
  ∀ (program : List Stmt) (tgCtx1 tgCtx2 : ThreadgroupContext),
    tgCtx1.sharedMemory = tgCtx2.sharedMemory → -- ADD THIS
    -- ... other hypotheses
```

---

### Category 5: Counterexample Construction (5 occurrences)

**Locations**:
- Line 1320: `arithmetic_preserves_order_independence`
- Line 1323: `prefix_operations_not_order_independent`  
- Line 1326: `overlapping_writes_not_order_independent`
- Line 1329: `non_commutative_ops_not_order_independent`  
- Line 1334: Additional counterexample

**Pattern**: Need concrete programs showing violations of order independence.

**Example**:
```lean
theorem prefix_operations_not_order_independent :
  ∃ (op : WaveOp), ¬ isWaveOrderIndependent op := by
  use WaveOp.prefixSum (PureExpr.literal 1)
  -- Show WavePrefixSum([1,1,1]) with different lane orders gives different results
  sorry
```

**Reason**: Negative results strengthening the theory by showing boundaries.

---

### Category 6: Main Theorem Implementation (3 occurrences)

**Locations**:
- Line 1588: `threadgroupExampleWithLoops_order_independent`
- Line 1708: `compileTimeDeterministic_program_orderIndependent` induction  
- Line 1384: Additional main theorem gap

**Pattern**: High-level proof strategy composition.

**Example**:
```lean
| cons stmt rest ih =>
  simp [List.foldl] 
  -- Apply appropriate theorem for stmt type, then use ih
  sorry
```

**Reason**: Requires choosing how to dispatch to individual theorems and compose results.

---

### Category 7: Loop Body Execution (2 occurrences)

**Locations**:
- Line 695: `uniformFor` simplified loop execution
- Additional loop execution model gap

**Pattern**: Simplified execution model for loops.

**Code**:
```lean
have h_body_eq : body.foldl (fun ctx stmt => execStmt stmt ctx) tgCtx1 =
                body.foldl (fun ctx stmt => execStmt stmt ctx) tgCtx2 := by
  -- This would be proven by induction on the body statements
  sorry
```

**Reason**: Our model uses simplified single-iteration loop execution rather than full iterative semantics.

---

### Category 8: Other Infrastructure (6 occurrences)

**Locations**:
- Line 1415: `arithmetic_preserves_order_independence`
- Line 1444: `uniform_control_flow_preserves_order_independence`
- Line 1508: Additional infrastructure
- Line 1619: Helper lemma gap
- Line 1624: Helper lemma gap  
- Line 1626: Helper lemma gap
- Line 1650: Helper lemma gap
- Line 1654: Helper lemma gap

**Pattern**: Various helper lemmas and supporting infrastructure.

**Reason**: Supporting infrastructure for main theoretical results.
