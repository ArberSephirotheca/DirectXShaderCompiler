# Cooperative Scheduling Design for MiniHLSL Interpreter

## Key Insights from Your Feedback

You're absolutely right! The proper GPU execution model requires:

1. **Cooperative Execution**: Threads pause and wait at synchronization points
2. **Non-uniform Wave Operations**: Work with currently active lanes only  
3. **Barrier Analysis**: Use DBEG to ensure correct barrier participation
4. **Dynamic Scheduling**: Pick ready threads when others are waiting

## Proposed Architecture

### Thread States
```cpp
enum class ThreadState {
    Ready,           // Ready to execute next statement
    WaitingAtBarrier, // Waiting for barrier synchronization  
    WaitingForWave,  // Waiting for wave operation to complete
    Completed,       // Thread has finished execution
    Error            // Thread encountered an error
};
```

### Wave Operation Handling
```cpp
// When a thread hits a wave operation:
1. Determine currently active lanes in the wave (not all 32!)
2. Check if all currently active lanes have reached this wave op
3. If not, mark thread as WaitingForWave and schedule other threads
4. When all active lanes reach the op, compute result and wake all threads
```

### Barrier Handling
```cpp  
// When a thread hits a barrier:
1. Use DBEG analysis to determine which threads MUST reach this barrier
2. Check if all required threads have arrived
3. If not, mark thread as WaitingAtBarrier and schedule other threads  
4. Detect UB if not all lanes in a wave reach the barrier
5. When all required threads arrive, release all waiting threads
```

### Execution Loop
```cpp
while (!allThreadsCompleted()) {
    // Process completed synchronization points
    processWaveOperations();
    processBarriers();
    
    // Get threads ready to execute
    auto readyThreads = getReadyThreads();
    if (readyThreads.empty()) {
        if (hasWaitingThreads()) {
            // Deadlock detection
            reportDeadlock();
        }
        break;
    }
    
    // Select next thread according to ordering
    ThreadId next = selectNextThread(readyThreads, ordering);
    
    // Execute one statement
    executeOneStep(next);
}
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Realistic GPU Model**: Matches actual GPU execution behavior
2. **Proper Synchronization**: Handles barriers and wave ops correctly
3. **Non-uniform Support**: Wave ops work with current active mask
4. **Deadlock Detection**: Can detect barrier UB conditions
5. **Order Testing**: Different scheduling orders test race conditions

## Integration with DBEG

The Dynamic Block Execution Graph from your validator can be used to:
- Determine which threads must participate in barriers
- Detect when barrier participation is incomplete (UB)
- Analyze control flow divergence patterns
- Validate that wave operations are safe in current context

## Example: Non-uniform Wave Operation

```hlsl
if (WaveGetLaneIndex() < 16) {
    // Only lanes 0-15 are active here
    float sum = WaveActiveSum(value); // Should work with just these 16 lanes
}
```

In the interpreter:
1. Thread 0-15 reach the wave operation
2. Interpreter sees active mask = 0x0000FFFF (first 16 bits)
3. Waits for all 16 active threads to reach this point
4. Computes sum over just these 16 values
5. All 16 threads get the same result

## Example: Barrier with Analysis

```hlsl
if (threadId < 32) {
    // Only first 32 threads participate
    GroupMemoryBarrierWithGroupSync(); // Must have all 32 threads
}
```

Using DBEG:
1. Analyze that threads 0-31 will reach the barrier
2. Thread 32+ will not reach it (not UB if they're in different dynamic blocks)
3. Wait for threads 0-31 to arrive
4. If any of 0-31 don't arrive, it's UB (deadlock)

This approach would make the interpreter much more realistic and useful for finding actual GPU programming bugs!

## Implementation Priority

Given the complexity, I suggest:
1. **Phase 1**: Simple wave ops with current active lanes (your original issue)
2. **Phase 2**: Add cooperative scheduling for barriers  
3. **Phase 3**: Full DBEG integration for UB detection
4. **Phase 4**: Performance optimizations

Would you like me to implement Phase 1 first (fixing the current wave operation issue) and then we can iteratively add the cooperative scheduling?
