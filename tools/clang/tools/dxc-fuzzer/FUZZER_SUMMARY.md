# MiniHLSL Interpreter Fuzzer - Implementation Summary

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a trace-guided fuzzing framework for the MiniHLSL interpreter that focuses on semantics-preserving testing of control flow and wave operations.

## Completed Components

### 1. Core Fuzzer Framework (✓)
- **MiniHLSLInterpreterFuzzer.h/cpp**: Main fuzzer framework with:
  - ExecutionTrace data structures for capturing complete execution state
  - Mutation strategy interfaces
  - Semantic validator for checking equivalence
  - Bug reporter for tracking found issues
  - Main fuzzer orchestrator

### 2. Trace Capture (✓)
- **MiniHLSLInterpreterTraceCapture.h/cpp**: TraceCaptureInterpreter that extends the base interpreter
  - Captures thread hierarchy and wave mapping
  - Records control flow decisions
  - Tracks wave operation synchronization
  - Monitors variable accesses and memory state

### 3. Mutation Strategies (✓ Framework, ⚠️ Implementation)
- **MiniHLSLInterpreterFuzzerMutations.cpp**: Placeholder implementations for:
  - ExplicitLaneDivergenceMutation
  - LoopUnrollingMutation
  - PrecomputeWaveResultsMutation
  - RedundantWaveSyncMutation
  - ForceBlockBoundariesMutation
  - SerializeMemoryAccessesMutation

### 4. Build System (✓)
- Updated CMakeLists.txt to build minihlsl-fuzzer
- Created minihlsl_fuzzer_main.cpp for standalone execution
- Successfully compiles and links

### 5. Documentation (✓)
- FUZZING_STRATEGY.md: Complete strategy documentation
- FUZZER_README.md: Usage instructions
- FUZZER_STATUS.md: Current implementation status

## Current Status

### Completed ✓
1. **AST Access**: Added getter methods to control flow statements (IfStmt, ForStmt, WhileStmt, DoWhileStmt)
2. **Virtual Hook Methods**: Added virtual hooks to MiniHLSLInterpreter for trace capture
3. **AST Cloning**: All AST nodes now have clone() methods
4. **Build System**: Successfully builds and links
5. **Basic Testing**: Test program runs and executes fuzzing framework

### Remaining Work
1. **RedundantWaveSync**: Not yet implemented
2. **LibFuzzer Integration**: Need to link with -fsanitize=fuzzer for feedback-driven fuzzing
3. **Seed Corpus**: Need real HLSL programs for testing
4. **Hook Implementation**: Some interpreter hooks need to be called in more places

### Working Mutations
- **ForceBlockBoundaries**: Wraps statements in `if(true)` blocks to force new block boundaries
  - Successfully generates mutants
  - Tested with control flow program
  
- **ExplicitLaneDivergence**: Converts implicit divergence to explicit lane tests
  - Replaces if conditions with explicit lane/wave index checks
  - Successfully generates mutants for divergent control flow
  
- **LoopUnrolling**: Unrolls loops with known iteration counts
  - Creates guarded iterations based on trace data
  - Limits unrolling to 10 iterations
  
- **PrecomputeWaveResults**: Placeholder for replacing wave ops with traced values
  - Framework in place but needs implementation

## How It Works

1. **Trace Capture**: Execute seed program and record complete execution trace
2. **Mutation Generation**: Apply semantics-preserving transformations
3. **Validation**: Execute mutants and compare traces
4. **Bug Detection**: Report any semantic divergence as interpreter bugs

## Next Steps

1. **Add AST Cloning**: Implement clone() methods for all AST nodes
2. **Add Virtual Hooks**: Make trace capture methods virtual in base interpreter
3. **Implement Mutations**: Complete the actual mutation logic
4. **LibFuzzer Integration**: Link with libFuzzer for feedback-driven fuzzing
5. **Test on Real Programs**: Run fuzzer on actual HLSL kernels

## Building and Running

```bash
cd ~/dxc_workspace/DirectXShaderCompiler/build-fuzzer
cmake --build . --target minihlsl-fuzzer
./bin/minihlsl-fuzzer

# To run the test program:
cmake --build . --target test-minihlsl-fuzzer
./bin/test-minihlsl-fuzzer
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Trace-Guided Approach**: Captures complete execution state for validation
2. **Semantics-Preserving Mutations**: All mutations maintain program behavior
3. **Wave-Aware**: Special handling for GPU wave operations
4. **Differential Testing**: Compares traces to find interpreter inconsistencies

## Technical Achievements

- Successfully integrated with existing MiniHLSLInterpreter codebase
- Created comprehensive execution trace data structures
- Designed mutation strategies specific to GPU programming patterns
- Built framework that compiles and runs

Despite the limitations, this provides a solid foundation for finding bugs in the MiniHLSL interpreter's handling of control flow and wave operations.
