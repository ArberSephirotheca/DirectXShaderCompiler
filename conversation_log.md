# Conversation Log: Threadgroup-Level Order Independence

## Context
We extended the miniHLSL order independence proof from wave-level to threadgroup-level, implementing:

1. **ThreadgroupContext** - models multiple waves with shared memory
2. **SharedMemory** - tracks data and access patterns per address  
3. **Memory Safety Constraints** - disjoint writes, commutative operations
4. **Threadgroup Order Independence Property** - same result regardless of wave execution order
5. **Formal Proofs** - theorems showing threadgroup operations are order-independent
6. **Counterexamples** - overlapping writes, non-commutative ops break independence

## Key Technical Insights

### ExecutionContext Clarification
- `ExecutionContext` represents a **single GPU wave** (32-64 threads in lockstep)
- NOT a threadgroup (which contains multiple waves)
- `activeLanes` can be empty (divergent control flow, early returns)

### Lean Proof Techniques
- **Structural Induction**: `induction expr with` 
- **`simp`**: Automatic simplification, unfolds definitions
- **`rw`**: Manual rewriting using specific equalities
- **`generalizing`**: Makes induction work with external parameters
- **Function Extensionality**: `funext` to prove function equality

### Order Independence Levels
- **Wave-level**: Lane execution order within a wave doesn't matter
- **Threadgroup-level**: Wave execution order within threadgroup doesn't matter
- **Constraints**: Disjoint memory writes + commutative operations required

## Files Modified
- `tools/clang/tools/dxc-fuzzer/proof/OrderIndependenceProof.lean`
  - Extended to model threadgroup execution
  - Added shared memory modeling
  - Implemented threadgroup-level order independence proofs
  - Added helper lemma `evalPureExpr_deterministic`
  - Added counterexamples for race conditions

## Next Steps
The proof framework now supports threadgroup-level order independence testing, enabling detection of subtle reconvergence bugs where different wave execution orders produce different results in shader compilation.
